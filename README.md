At the time of this writing all you have to do is run the oneliner.sh script and it will get all the mp3 files for you. 

It uses the full_list.txt file to know the addresses for the mp3 files. 

I have also included grabber.py, the python file I wrote to generate the full_list.txt.
if you choose to use this one you need to edit the file to add your username and password.
if you haven't already you also need to 
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests

feel free to use/modify/improve as you see fit.
